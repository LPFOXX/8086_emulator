# 8086 Emulator

I started this project as a means to learn Test Driven Development (TDD), but it had since grown on me and I found out that it was also great to learn how (micro)processors work.

I've drawn inspiration from Dave Poo's series [_6502 CPU Emulator in C++_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLwK93hM93Z13TRzPx9JqTIn33feefl37) and decided to emulate a microprocessor by myself.

The microprocessor chosen was the 8086 because I started learning 16bit microprocessors architecture at University where we targeted 808(5-6) microprocessors.

This project won't be extensive in the sense I will implement every single instruction of the 8086 microprocessor. Because, again, the main goal is to learn and apply best practices of **Software Testing**, comprehend (micro)processors architecture and have some fun along the way.
